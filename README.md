## 🔍 About Me

I am currently enrolled in a 12-month Data Science Learnership. The first six months focused on technical training (Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel), and now I’m gaining real-world work experience in the Finance Department of an insurance company. I enjoy using data to solve problems, create insights, and support business decisions.
